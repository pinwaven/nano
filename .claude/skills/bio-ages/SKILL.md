## 11. The Four Sub Bio Ages

Waven Nano measures biological age across four independent dimensions. Each dimension produces a **sub-age** (in years) that contributes equally to the combined `BioAge`.

> **Canonical source:** When referring to `BiomarkerEstimator` or `BioAgeCalculator`, the canonical (production) versions are in `src/functions/worker/lib/`. The copies under `src/lib/` are mirrors kept in sync but are not used at runtime. All calibration changes, tests, and fixes go to the worker copies first.

### Canonical keys

These exact strings are used everywhere — in `bioage_profile.SubAges`, the `dots.sub_age_target` column, and any code that routes biomarkers to dots:

| Key (code)                   | English display    | Chinese display | DB value (`sub_age_target`) |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `SubAges.CellularAge`      | Cellular Age       | 细胞年龄        | `Cellular Age`              |
| `SubAges.MetabolicAge`     | Metabolic Age      | 代谢年龄        | `Metabolic Age`             |
| `SubAges.MicroVascularAge` | Micro-Vascular Age | 微血管年龄      | `Micro-Vascular Age`        |
| `SubAges.ResilienceAge`    | Resilience Age     | 抗压年龄        | `Resilience Age`            |

### Dimension details

#### 1. Cellular Age (`CellularAge`)

- **What it measures:** Raw vitality of individual cells — NAD+ metabolism, senescence burden, sirtuin activity.
- **Input biomarkers:** `GDF-15` (pg/mL), `CD38` (fold-change above 1.0)
- **Reference ranges:**
  - GDF-15: `<750` normal · `750–1500` elevated · `>1500` accelerated aging
  - CD38: `~1.0` baseline; each fold above 1.0 degrades NAD+ faster
- **Scoring:** Hill function on GDF-15; linear penalty on CD38; equal-weighted average
- **Target dots:** DOT01 (NMN), DOT02 (Apigenin/CD38 inhibitor), DOT03 (Trans-Resveratrol), DOT04 (senolytic blend), DOT06 (Collagen matrix), DOT10 (Dynamine+TeaCrine)

#### 2. Metabolic Age (`MetabolicAge`)

- **What it measures:** Fuel-burning efficiency and mitochondrial throughput.
- **Input biomarker:** `GA` — Glycated Albumin (%)
- **Reference ranges:** `<15%` normal · `15–20%` elevated · `>20%` metabolic dysfunction
- **Scoring:** Sigmoid centered at 14.5%; if `ResilienceAge` score < 4, a 10% coupling penalty is applied (high inflammation degrades metabolism)
- **Target dots:** DOT05 (Urolithin A + Ca-AKG), DOT07 (PQQ), DOT11 (Cordyceps + Rhodiola)

#### 3. Micro-Vascular Age (`MicroVascularAge`)

- **What it measures:** Capillary health and nutrient/O₂ delivery to tissues.
- **Input biomarker:** `Cystatin C` (mg/L)
- **Reference ranges:** `<0.9` normal · `0.9–1.2` elevated · `>1.2` vascular/renal stress
- **Scoring:** Exponential decay from optimal threshold of 0.68 mg/L
- **Target dots:** DOT08 (Vascular Awakening — Beta-Alanine, Niacin, Methyl-B), DOT13 (CoQ10 + Nattokinase), DOT14 (D3 + K2 + MCT)

#### 4. Resilience Age (`ResilienceAge`)

- **What it measures:** Capacity to buffer chronic stress and suppress systemic inflammation.
- **Input biomarkers:** `hsCRP` (mg/L), `IL-6` (pg/mL)
- **Reference ranges:**
  - hsCRP: `<1` normal · `1–3` elevated · `>3` high inflammation
  - IL-6: `<3` normal · `3–6` elevated · `>6` high inflammation
- **Scoring:** Exponential decay from optimal thresholds (0.5 mg/L CRP, 1.5 pg/mL IL-6); equal-weighted
- **Target dots:** DOT09 (Curcumin), DOT12 (Deep Sleep stack), DOT15 (Kanna + Saffron), DOT16 (Glutathione + NAC), DOT17 (Gut + Microbiome), DOT18 (Immunity + Gastric)

### Data flow

```
Kino chip scan
  → raw biomarker values (hsCRP, IL-6, GDF-15, CD38, GA, CystatinC)
  → BioAgeCalculator.calculateBioAge(chronoAge, biomarkers)
  → bioage_profile = { BioAge, ChronoAge, SubAges: { CellularAge, MetabolicAge, MicroVascularAge, ResilienceAge }, Scores, ... }
  → stored in biomarkers.data JSONB column
  → systemNutrition prompt uses bioage_profile + biomarkers
  → dots.sub_age_target drives which dots are prioritized per elevated dimension
```

### Coupling rule

`MetabolicAge` is the only dimension with cross-dimension coupling: when `ResilienceAge` score < 4 (severe inflammation), Metabolic scoring takes a 10% penalty. This reflects the biological reality that chronic inflammation accelerates metabolic dysfunction.

### A dot is referenced by `key_name`, never by `dots.id`

Same class of coupling rule as the sub-age keys above, and it has already been violated once.
`dots.id` is a row number. `migration_dots_new_lineup.sql` (2026-07-25) replaced the whole
formulary and **reused the ids**, so anything persisting an id silently began pointing at a
different dot — no error, no filter-out, every lookup succeeding.

`health_plan_templates.recommended_dot_ids` was the casualty
(`migration_health_plan_recommended_dot_keys.sql`): six seeded focus lists spent six weeks
recommending macular and skin dots for a weight-loss plan, and omitting the only sleep dot from
the sleep plan. That column now stores `key_name` strings; its name is historical.

**Any new column, JSONB field, event payload or API response that names a dot uses `key_name`.**
Integers may be read for backward compatibility, and an entry that resolves to nothing must be
**dropped, not guessed** — a loud, countable gap is the entire point of the stable identity.
